# Fizzwidget Hunter Helper  
  
Features  
When you mouse over a beast in the world, the tooltip will show which abilities a Hunter could learn after taming it. (Or no additional info if the beast doesn’t have any known abilities.)  
  
If you’re currently playing a hunter, the abilities will be colored according to whether you’ve already learned them: green for abilities you have yet to learn, and gray for those you already know. Hunter’s Helper will notice when you learn new abilities and will automatically refresh its index whenever you open the Beast Training window. (If you already know a few abilities, you should open you Beast Training window the first time you play after installing Hunter’s Helper.)  
  
Need to know where to find new abilities for your pet? Type (for example) /huntershelper find Bite 6 to get a list of beasts known to have that ability. Results are sorted by zone, with those areas closest to (or most accessible from) your current location first. (The list cuts off after four zones if you look for an ability found on a wide variety of beast types.)  
  
Hunter’s Helper also notifies you in chat if you tame a beast whose skillset isn’t what was expected.   
  
Chat Commands  
/huntershelper (or /hh) < command > - where < command > can be any of the following:  
  
help - Print this list.  
status - Check current settings.  
on|off - enable/disable display of pet abilities in beast tooltips.  
find < name > < rank > - Lists in the chat window which beasts have an ability and where they can be found.  
  
Caveats, Known Bugs, Etc.  
Sometimes we fail to parse the chat notification that happens when you learn a new ability from your pet.  
If you see an ability still showing up green in beast tooltips after you’ve learned it, just open your Beast Training window and we’ll rebuild our list.  
  
### Hunter Helper was created by the wonderful Gazmik Fizzwidget, He's got what you need!  
  
Really, I’m not one to gallivant about the wilderness trying to make friends with beasts… at my size, it’s a good way to get eaten! Besides, keeping a full stock of bits & bibbles for your critter can be terrible for your cash flow. But a Hunter friend of mine managed to convince me there’d be good money in outfitting such outdoorsy types, and before I knew it my workbench was cluttered with all sorts of animal-seeking, food-measuring, and pet-minding contraptions.  
  
This gadget couldn’t be any simpler to use: point it at a beast you see in the wild, and its zootropic neurowave scanner will analyze the critter’s noggin and tell you what, if any, new tricks it can teach you.* Know what you’re looking for, but not sure where to look? It’ll help with that, too — I’ve pre-programmed it with an extensive database on creature behavior (straight from the Encyclopedia Azerothica), easily indexed by skill.  

### * Not recommended for use by elderly gnolls.
